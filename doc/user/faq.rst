What are the main features of icesat2DB?
----------------------------------------

icesat2DB is a TileDB-based Python package designed to efficiently manage, query, and analyze large-scale ICESat-2 data. Its main features include:

- **Efficient data storage**: Stores ICESat-2 data using TileDB arrays, enabling optimized access and scalability.
- **Geospatial querying**: Provides spatially enabled querying for regions of interest with support for bounding boxes and polygons.
- **Automated processing**: Facilitates loading, pre-filtering, and processing of ICESat-2 ATL08 data product.
- **Parallelized operations**: Leverages parallel engines (e.g., Dask) for distributed data processing, enhancing performance on large datasets.
- **Integration with Python libraries**: Outputs data in formats compatible with pandas, geopandas, and xarray for seamless analysis.

How do I set up the database for ICESat-2?
-----------------------------------------

The TileDB database is set up automatically using the `icesat2DB` package. By default, it creates and manages the schema required for ICESat-2 data. If you prefer to use a pre-existing database, ensure that the structure aligns with the schema defined by `icesat2DB`.

What data products does icesat2DB support?
------------------------------------------

icesat2DB (currently) supports the following ICESat-2 data products:

- **Level ATL08**

Can I use the ICESat-2 database on cloud-hosted databases?
---------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the ICESat-2 database can be deployed on cloud-hosted storage systems like AWS S3. Use TileDB’s integration with cloud platforms to store and access ICESat-2 data seamlessly. Refer to the cloud storage documentation in TileDB for setup instructions.

Can I add data to my ICESat-2 database?
--------------------------------------

Yes, you can add data to an existing ICESat-2 database using `icesat2DB`. Simply configure the database with the appropriate schema and use the :py:class:`icesat2db.IceSat2Processor` class to process and ingest new data. Make sure to backup your database before making modifications.

How do I write ICESat-2 data into the database?
----------------------------------------------

ICESat-2 data can be written to the database using the :py:class:`icesat2db.IceSat2Processor` class. Steps include:

1. Configure the `data_config.yml` file with paths to your ICESat-2 HDF5 files and database settings.
2. Use the :py:class:`icesat2db.IceSat2Processor` to process and insert data into the TileDB database.
3. Monitor logs for any errors or warnings during processing.
